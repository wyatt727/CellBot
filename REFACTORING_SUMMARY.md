   - Identified key constraints: CPU/memory limitations, battery considerations, network reliability
   - Documented target environment specifications

2. **Code Refactoring**
   - Removed desktop-specific code and dependencies
   - Simplified the codebase to focus on terminal-based interaction
   - Removed GUI components and unnecessary features

3. **Documentation**
   - Created NetHunter-specific documentation
   - Updated installation instructions for mobile environment
   - Added troubleshooting guides for common mobile issues

### Phase 2: Mobile Optimization

1. **Project Structure Streamlining**
   - Removed unnecessary files and directories
   - Consolidated code into a more efficient structure
   - Renamed files to better reflect their purpose in the mobile context

2. **Command Structure Adaptation**
   - Modified command aliases for mobile use
   - Removed desktop-specific commands
   - Simplified command interface for terminal use

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Implemented connection pooling for improved performance
   - Added mobile-specific optimizations to database queries
   - Optimized similarity search for mobile execution

4. **System Prompt Adaptation**
   - Modified system prompt to utilize Android-specific configurations
   - Implemented caching for improved performance
   - Added fallback mechanisms for mobile environment

5. **LLM Client Optimization**
   - Enhanced for mobile networks with retry mechanisms
   - Improved session handling for mobile execution
   - Added mobile-specific options for API requests

6. **Testing and Final Cleanup**
   - Created testing script for NetHunter environment
   - Added logging improvements for mobile debugging
   - Final code cleanup and optimization

## Key Optimizations

### Resource Management

- **Adaptive Threading**: Automatically adjusts thread usage based on device capabilities
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently manages database connections to reduce resource usage
- **Caching**: Implements strategic caching to avoid redundant operations
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduces memory footprint for mobile execution

### Network Awareness

- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implements exponential backoff for unstable connections
- **Payload Optimization**: Reduces data transfer sizes for mobile networks
- **Timeout Handling**: Adapts timeouts based on network conditions

### Storage Efficiency

- **Query Optimization**: Enhances database queries with early termination
- **Similarity Search**: Implements mobile-friendly similarity algorithms
- **I/O Reduction**: Minimizes disk operations to improve performance and battery life

### Battery Considerations

- **Background Limitations**: Restricts background operations to preserve battery
- **Resource Cleanup**: Efficiently manages resources when idle
- **Conservative Defaults**: Uses conservative default settings to balance performance and battery life

## New Features

1. **Environment Testing**: Added `test_nethunter_env.py` to verify the NetHunter environment
2. **Installation Scripts**: Created `install_nethunter.sh` and `transfer_to_nethunter.sh` for easy setup
3. **Android Configuration**: Added `android_config.py` with mobile-specific settings
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated README with NetHunter-specific instructions

- `nethunter_cellbot.py`: Added improved error handling and logging
- `README.md`: Updated with NetHunter-specific documentation

## Files Added

- `test_nethunter_env.py`: Environment testing script
- `install_nethunter.sh`: Installation script for NetHunter
- `transfer_to_nethunter.sh`: Script to transfer files from desktop to NetHunter
- `agent/android_config.py`: Android-specific configuration
- `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Files Removed

- `agent/gui_success.py`: Removed GUI components
- `agent/main.py`: Consolidated into NetHunter-specific entry point
- `agent/macbot.py`: Removed desktop-specific code
- `agent/Architecture.md`: Replaced with NetHunter documentation
- `cleanup.py`: No longer needed
- `test_report.txt`: Replaced with new testing approach
- `tests/` directory: Replaced with mobile-specific testing

## Conclusion

The refactoring process has successfully optimized CellBot for the NetHunter environment, ensuring efficient operation on mobile devices while maintaining core functionality. The codebase is now more streamlined, resource-efficient, and better suited for terminal-based interaction on a rooted OnePlus 12 running OxygenOS 15.
